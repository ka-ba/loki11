====

A C++ Template library, developed by  Andrei Alexandrescu.

For more information about the original loki please consult the original README, which was moved to [README.loki.md](/README.loki.md)

Loki11
====

Beware! Loki11 ist still work in progress. It's an ongoing attempt to reach the following goal:

This version of loki brings it into the modern age, but stays before the [big bang](https://youtu.be/yUIFdL3D0Vk?t=280) - that means it contents itself with a C++11 toolchain. The reason for the latter is that a lot of projects still need to lean on C++ 11/14/17. This is a matching version of loki for these projects.
